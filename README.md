# n2graph
Tool to graph nagios's performance data

This tool requires a LAMP stack. It's under development, although the code is fully functional. It's a very minimal version. I'm working now on install instructions, but if you like to try it before I complete, you can write me to rueda.raul at gmail dot com.
